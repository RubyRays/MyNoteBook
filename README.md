# MyNoteBook
My notebook web application.

This app makes use of mongodb and other node.js and express.js features to create user community. Users are able to register and login by entering their username, email
and password. 

Inside of the web app the users are able to add their own profile picture from their computer and add, delete, edit and share their posts. 

The eraser icon deletes the post, the pencil icon activates the edit function and the edit button submits the changes and makes the edit form disappear, the last icon is
the share icon that allows the post to be displayed on the public page where all users have access. 

Upon the creation of a post the date, time, and weather information is displayed. (The weather is displayed as an icon and this makes use of the user ip information to 
get the city that they live in and adds it to the weather api as a parameter).

The "go to page" button takes the user to a separate page where all information in the post is displayed.
